Time Complexity (TC):
O(n) – We traverse the list to find the middle, reverse the second half, and compare both halves.

Space Complexity (SC):
O(1) – Reversal and comparison are done in-place without using extra data structures.

Approach:
Use two pointers (slow and fast) to find the middle of the linked list.
Reverse the second half of the list and compare it with the first half node by node.
If all values match, it's a palindrome; otherwise, it's not.
